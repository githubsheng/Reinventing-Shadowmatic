# Reinventing-Shadowmatic

This 3d library renderes models in obj format in browser using `webgl`

This library only uses a library called `glmatrix`, for fast matrix and vector calculation.

# To use the library

You can copy the `bundle.js` in the dist folder to your own repository, and the js files in the `lib` filder if you dont already have them in your page.

A live demo can be found here: xxxxx

Here is a static snapshot of how it looks like. The scene was inspired by a game called `shadowmatic`.
