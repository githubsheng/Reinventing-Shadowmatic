# Reinventing-Shadowmatic

This is an experimental project for directly using webgl for rendering.

It only uses a library called `glmatrix`, for fast matrix and vector calculation, and nothing else.

It render models in obj format in browser.


# To use the library

You can copy the `bundle.js` in the dist folder to your own repository, and the js files in the `lib` filder if you dont already have them in your page.

A live demo can be found here: https://githubsheng.github.io/WSModelViewer/p.html

Here is a static snapshot of how it looks like. The scene was inspired by a game called `shadowmatic`.
