# Reinventing-Shadowmatic

This 3d library renderes models in obj format in browser using `webgl`

This library only uses a library called `glmatrix`, for fast matrix and vector calculation.

# To use the library

You can copy the `bundle.js` in the dist folder to your own repository, and the js files in the `lib` filder if you dont already have them in your page.

A live demo can be found here: https://githubsheng.github.io/WSModelViewer/p.html

Here is a static snapshot of how it looks like. The scene was inspired by a game called `shadowmatic`.

# To further develop this library

You need to install `webpack` to deal with the import / export in the code.

Below are a list of memos I wrote when I was making this library. It explains some of the issues I encountered and how I decided to solve them... But they are in Chinese though, so if you cannot understand the language, maybe you can check out the incode comments, they are mostly in English.
